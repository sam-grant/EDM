- Possible issues that might be causing problem
	
	1. Vertical offset
	2. Biasing towards the momentum distribution somehow (can prove otherwise)
	3. Acceptance (appears to require new sim at this point)
	4. Problem in sim 

X - Use slopeTest macro to get plot out one of the muon beam hists
	* DEADLINE 10:15

- Write function to correct for vertical offset
	* DEADLINE 11:30 

- Overlay corrected vertical offset truth scans with uncorrected (preferably do the same for reco)
	* DEALINE 12:30

- Overlay fixed stats with floating stats scan (truth)
	* DEADLINE 13:30 

- Rewrite talk, include phase shift? 
	* DEADLINE 14:30 

- Practice talk
