- Update talk from yesterday and post to doc db 
X - Get /gm2/app/users/sgrant/analysis/EDM/EDMSim/GasGunDebug/fcl/generateAndMakeDecayNTuple.fcl up and running. Also gm2analyses/DecayNtup_module.cc
- Read through code base & understand
X - Produce 10 decays, print out all info.
- Try to calculate what you think they should be. 
- Compare to Dominika

---- 

Positron polarisation always get to zero, does this effect anything? 
Seems like everything is just calculated by Geant

- Turning on spin tracking doesn't help
- setPolarization doesn't help

------

Set mom to (0,0,magicMom)
Set pos to (0,0,magicRad)

// Not sure you really need to do this if you're setting the momemntum like that
Set pol to (0,0,1);
