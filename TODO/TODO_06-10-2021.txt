* Hadd 1.5 million decay sample
* Keep monitoring main sample 
* Run plottter on 1.5 mil 
* Take a look at the curve
* Put on some slides 
* Ultimately I need dilution for decay assymetry and acceptance, and then tracker based stuff (such as alignment).
* Tidy up EDM directory, espcially the fcl files. Will need to rename some stuff.
