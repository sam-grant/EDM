Asymmetry 
---------

- Important: why do tan(px/py) and others produce a uniform distribution? 
- Important: Why does the vertical angle RMS bias towards low/mid momentum in the MRF?
X - Finish up the checks with trying to get the assymetry via the angles
X - Contact Dominika
X - Can we plot the ampltidude over the maximum angular difference? (Fitted amplitdue over the max angular diff)
- Tidy up SimulatedAsymmetry.C
- Normalise the differential asymmetry plots 
- Perform a fit the vertical asymmetry plot 


Radial field
------------

- Per calo analysis 
- Calo align jumps / run (way to do this more cleverly?)
- Take a closer look at the CBO thing 
- Take a look at the radial field simulation 
- Start work on slides for collaboration meeting
