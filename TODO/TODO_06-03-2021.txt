- Use Joe's module to generate some muon decay plots for the full dataset in order to verfiy the simulation 
- Cross check the shape in the 60 hour
- Report results and say that it's not understood.
- Redo symmetric cuts scan based on the pmin/pmax scans 
- Use pmin/pmax scans to pick some symmetric momentum cuts, get diluton for those.
