Asymmetry 

X- Figure out how to make a TH1 go negative
- Fit the damn thing
- Put the g-2 asymetry on slides 
	- Can we do this for actual sample that you're using? 
- Review method for up/down stuff






Radial field
--------
- Per calo analysis 
- Calo align jumps / run (way to do this more cleverly?)
- Take a closer look at the CBO thing 
- Prove the g-2 assymetry with forwards backward asymmetry
