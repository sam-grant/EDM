* Gas gun for all decays
X - Test fcl file for all decays, run small sample 100 jobs at 5000 events each or something (do some testing)
X - Think about how to run this directly into an ntuple, either chain fcl files or write a new fcl 
X - Run new sample based on the size of the output files
- Tidy up EDM directory again, espcially the fcl files. Will need to rename some stuff. 

Currently running for 2.5 million decays, hopefully the grid can handle it. Didn't really test it.

Other misc 

- Generaralise FoldedWiggle into a single drawing function and stick it in FancyDraw for use in data.
- Move Bz simulatenous anaylsis into it's own function in the UnblindedEDMSimFitter.
- Take a look at beam gun sim and communicate with Renee 
- Sort out radial field calo alignment 


Hi all, 

I'm having some trouble while trying to run two fcl files consecutively on the grid. I'd like to generate a gas gun file, and then run an analyzer on the output, without saving the intermediate file. 


My problem at the moment is that intermediate file name is not being updated. The first fcl file generates a file simply called gm2ringsim_particle_gun.root, but then the second fcl file gets told to run on a file called gm2offline_muon_gasgun_truth_18969_1623241357.1_1.root, which doesn’t exist. 

I’m running a test job using the standard script:

./gridSetupAndSubmitGM2Data.sh --mc --truth --noifdh_art --schemas=None --fcl runGasGunRing_EDM.fcl,RunPhaseAnalyzer.fcl --gasGun --localArea --output-dir=/pnfs/GM2/scratch/users/sgrant/dMuSim/TruthTreesAllDecays --njobs 1 --nevents 50 --lifetime=30m --noGrid

Thanks!
