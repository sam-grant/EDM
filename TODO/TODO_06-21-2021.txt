X - Simplying code and make some muon beam polaration plots 
- Produce plots in all reference frames with and without quality
X * MRF 
* AAR 
* WORLD
- Produce plots with muon pol angle 
* AAR
* WORLD

- Write seperate macro to present muon plots

- Look more closely at the vertical angle. Maybe we actually need a cut here? How to investigate.
- Look at the plots for the vertical angle and overlay them. 
* AAR
* WORLD
* MRF

Also overlay the modulo plots themselves! Might be quite interesting. Same as Dominika.
