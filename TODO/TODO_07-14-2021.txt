Asymmetry 
---------

X - Review Paul's note
X - Review method for up/down stuff
X - Review vertical angle mysteries, make notes
X - Clean up Plotter.C and TruthEDMSim.C to remove the min/max and sym scans
X - Ensure that Plotter.C includes all components of momentum
- Important: why does tan(px/py) produce a uniform distribution? 
- Try to redfine the vertical so that it doesn't include Z-component
- Important: prove that the vertical angle RMS does not decrease with momentum if you define theta_y this way
- Didn't work? What else could be driving the drop in vertical angle RMS?

Radial field
------------

- Per calo analysis 
- Calo align jumps / run (way to do this more cleverly?)
- Take a closer look at the CBO thing 
- Prove the g-2 assymetry with forwards backward asymmetry
