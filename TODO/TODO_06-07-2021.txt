... - Finish hadding muon beam plots

* Just take one sample, files are too big 
- Write quick macro to get plots out, think about them and understand

X - Submit jobs for Bz 

X- Cross check the shape in the 60 hour.

X * How does this make sense? If you see an assymetry then you're saying you've discovered an EDM !!!.

X * Just have a look anyway, might not be worth admitting to anyone that you did this. (Looks very similar). 

- Report results and say that it's not understood.

- Redo symmetric cuts scan based on the pmin/pmax scans 

- Use pmin/pmax scans to pick some symmetric momentum cuts, get diluton for those. 

- Write function to correct for vertical offset, may be a part of the issue 

- Need to fully rule out dependance on the momentum distribution 

X - Congratulate J. H. 

- Move Bz simulatenous anaylsis into it's own function in the UnblindedEDMSimFitter.

- Generaralise FoldedWiggle into a single drawing function and stick it in FancyDraw for use in data.

- List of possible issues that might be causing problem
	
	1. Vertical offset
	2. Biasing towards the momentum distribution somehow (can prove otherwise)
	3. Acceptance (appears to require new sim at this point)
	4. Problem in sim
