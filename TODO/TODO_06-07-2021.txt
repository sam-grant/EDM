... - Finish hadding muon beam plots
* Just take one sample, files are too big 
- Write quick macro to get plots out, think about them and understand
X - Submit jobs for Bz 
X- Cross check the shape in the 60 hour
X * How does this make sense? If you see an assymetry then you're saying you've discovered an EDM !!!
X * Just have a look anyway, might not be worth admitting to anyone that you did this. (Looks very similar)
- Report results and say that it's not understood.
- Redo symmetric cuts scan based on the pmin/pmax scans 
- Use pmin/pmax scans to pick some symmetric momentum cuts, get diluton for those. 
- Write function to correct for vertical offset 
- Write function to refill histogram bins with equal stats / bin 
X - Congratulate J. H.
